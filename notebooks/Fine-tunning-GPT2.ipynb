    "dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced\n",

    "\n",
    "“How could this happen?” Ser Harys Swyft moaned. “How? Even after the Whispering\n",
    "Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great host . . . what madness\n",

    "vulnerable that would leave them?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun,\n",
    "\f",
    "but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless\n",
    "lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to\n",
    "Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I would have done the same,” his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion\n",
    "might have. “You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime\n",
    "had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where\n",
    "the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident. The rivers form two sides of a\n",
    "triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to\n",
    "create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls rise\n",
    "sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of\n",
    "the opposite shores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger\n",
    "must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a\n",
    "third between the rivers, west of the moat. There is no other way, none.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,” the courier said. “We’d built palisades of sharpened\n",
    "stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers\n",
    "cutting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. No one was\n",
    "expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more\n",
    "than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before . . . well, with\n",
    "what we thought was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork,\n",
    "marching south . . . ”\n",

    "“And your outriders?” Ser Gregor Clegane’s face might have been hewn from rock. The\n",

    "\n",
    "The bloodstained messenger shook his head. “Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq\n",
    "Piper’s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,” the Mountain declared. “Cut them out\n",

    "Lord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold\n",
    "as the light shone off his father’s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was\n",
    "one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen\n",
    "before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was\n",
    "uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You said they came at night,” Ser Kevan prompted.\n",

    "happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp\n",
    "with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers.\n",
    "When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts\n",
    "and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys\n",
    "started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to\n",
    "kindling and three others overturned, men swept into the river and drowned . . . and\n",
    "those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot\n",
    "comprehend what he has just heard. “My lord father—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sorry, my lord,” the messenger said. “Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his\n",
    "raft overturned. He was very gallant.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths.\n",
    "Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the\n",
    "other side—if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice every time. He wondered if\n",
    "Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black\n",
    "water.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,” the messenger was saying. “While\n",
    "we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored\n",
    "horse. I saw Lord Umber’s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy\n",
    "who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I wasn’t there to see, but it’s\n",
    "said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our spearmen formed up\n",
    "a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged,\n",
    "they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the\n",
    "drawbridge and took them in the rear.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Gods save us,” Lord Lefford swore.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found\n",
    "Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all. Our\n",
    "south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order\n",
    "when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many\n",
    "bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went\n",
    "over to the foe.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Curse the man.” His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. “I warned Jaime\n",
    "not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.”\n",
    "\f",
    "Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened.\n",
    "His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but\n",
    "Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father’s shaven head.\n",
    "\n",
    "“How could it happen?” Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. “Ser Jaime taken, the siege\n",
    "broken . . . this is a catastrophe!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Addam Marbrand said, “I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the\n",
    "obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What can we do? Jaime’s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks\n",
    "and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from the west! They\n",
    "can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what’s to stop them? My lords, we are\n",
    "beaten. We must sue for peace.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Peace?” Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty\n",
    "cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. “There’s your peace, Ser\n",
    "Harys. My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red\n",
    "Keep with Lord Eddard’s head. You’ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup\n",
    "than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He’s winning . . . or hadn’t you\n",
    "noticed?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Two battles do not make a war,” Ser Addam insisted. “We are far from lost. I should\n",
    "welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,”\n",
    "offered Lord Lefford.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,” Tyrion said\n",
    "acidly. “And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard’s rotting head?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand’s daughters,” Lefford said hopefully. “If we\n",
    "give the lad his sisters back . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. “He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime\n",
    "Lannister’s life for two girls.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,” Lord Lefford said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion rolled his eyes. “If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime’s\n",
    "armor.”\n",
    "\f",
    "“if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,” Ser Addarn argued. “We should march on\n",
    "them at once.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,” said\n",
    "Ser Harys. “And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. “They have my son,” he said once more, in a voice\n",
    "that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. “Leave me. All of you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a\n",
    "look. “Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan\n",
    "crossed the room to the wine casks. “Uncle,” Tyrion called, “if you would be so kind—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Here.” His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord Tywin seated himself. “You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have\n",
    "used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would\n",
    "have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers. Dead . . . ” His hand\n",
    "curled into a fist. “Madness. Rank madness.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Joff’s only a boy,” Tyrion pointed out. “At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.”\n",
    "\n",
    "His father gave him a sharp look. “I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet\n",
    "married a whore.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in\n",
    "his face.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Our position is worse than you know,” his father went on. “It would seem we have a\n",
    "new king.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Kevan looked poleaxed. “A new—who? What have they done to Joffrey?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin’s thin lips. “Nothing . . . yet. My\n",
    "grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south.\n",
    "Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has\n",
    "claimed the crown. The bride’s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him\n",
    "\f",
    "their swords.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Those are grave tidings.” When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep\n",
    "as canyons.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My daughter commands us to ride for King’s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep\n",
    "against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.” His mouth tightened. “Commands us,\n",
    "mind you. In the name of the king and council.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“How is King Joffrey taking the news?” Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,” Lord Tywin said. “She fears he might insist on\n",
    "marching against Renly himself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“With what army?” Tyrion asked. “You don’t plan to give him this one, I hope?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He talks of leading the City Watch,” Lord Tywin said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If he takes the Watch, he’ll leave the city undefended,” Ser Kevan said. “And with Lord\n",
    "Stannis on Dragonstone . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes.” Lord Tywin looked down at his son. “I had thought you were the one made for\n",
    "motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why, Father,” said Tyrion, “that almost sounds like praise.” He leaned forward intently.\n",
    "“What of Stannis? He’s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel about his brother’s claim?”\n",
    "\n",
    "His father frowned. “I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger\n",
    "than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis\n",
    "is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from\n",
    "Asshai. What does it mean? Is any of it true?” He gave an irritated shrug. “Kevan, bring\n",
    "us the map.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it flat. “Jaime\n",
    "has left us in a bad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us. Our\n",
    "enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot\n",
    "retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle. Jaime is taken, and\n",
    "his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion\n",
    "continue to plague our foraging parties. To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis\n",
    "Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm’s End are\n",
    "calling their banners.”\n",
    "\f",
    "Tyrion smiled crookedly. “Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,” Lord Tywin Lannister\n",
    "said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. “Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully\n",
    "and the lords of the Trident with him now. Their combined power may exceed our own.\n",
    "And with Roose Bolton behind us . . . Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be\n",
    "caught between three armies.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with young Lord\n",
    "Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does not concern me.\n",
    "He is a wary man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork. He will be slow to give\n",
    "pursuit. So . . . on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal. Kevan, I want Ser Addam’s\n",
    "outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he requires, and send\n",
    "them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“As you say, my lord, but . . . why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. Some call it\n",
    "cursed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Let them,” Lord Tywin said. “Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his\n",
    "reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch. Each is\n",
    "to have three hundred horse. Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods\n",
    "Eye to the Red Fork.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“They will burn, my lord,” Ser Kevan said, rising. “I shall give the commands.” He bowed\n",
    "and made for the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "When they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. “Your savages might relish a bit of\n",
    "rapine. Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like—goods, stock,\n",
    "women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,” Tyrion\n",
    "commented, “but I should prefer to keep them with me.” Uncouth and unruly they might\n",
    "be, yet the wildlings were his, and he trusted them more than any of his father’s men. He\n",
    "was not about to hand them over.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Then you had best learn to control them. I will not have the city plundered.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The city?” Tyrion was lost. “What city would that be?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“King’s Landing. I am sending you to court.”\n",
    "\f",
    "It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated.\n",
    "\n",
    "He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. “And what am I to\n",
    "do there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Rule,” his father said curtly\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion hooted with laughter. “My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about\n",
    "that!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Let her say what she likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all. I\n",
    "blame those jackanapes on the council—our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester,\n",
    "and that cockless wonder Lord Varys. What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when\n",
    "he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a\n",
    "lord? The man’s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal. Harrenhal, that\n",
    "was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I am told he\n",
    "took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.” His father\n",
    "had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. “And\n",
    "dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of\n",
    "Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm. He lent honor to any man he served.\n",
    "Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do\n",
    "not seat him beside you on the high bench.” He pointed a finger at Tyrion’s face. “If\n",
    "Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must. And if these councillors are playing us false . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion knew. “Spikes,” he sighed. “Heads. Walls.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I see you have taken a few lessons from me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“More than you know, Father,” Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set\n",
    "the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit.\n",
    "Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to\n",
    "hold the left again. “Why me?” he asked, cocking his head to one side. “Why not my\n",
    "uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a . . . bigger man?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord Tywin rose abruptly. “You are my son.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody\n",
    "bastard, you think Jaime’s good as dead, so I’m all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap\n",
    "him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was\n",
    "made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still.\n",
    "\f",
    "The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father’s heels as Lord Tywin crossed\n",
    "the room. “One last thing,” he said at the door. “You will not take the whore to court.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone. Finally\n",
    "he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower. The ceiling was low, but\n",
    "that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he could see the gibbet his\n",
    "father had erected in the yard. The innkeep’s body turned slowly on its rope whenever\n",
    "the night wind gusted. Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the\n",
    "featherbed. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes\n",
    "opened. “M’lord,” she said with a drowsy smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. “I have a mind to take you to King’s\n",

    "in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead\n",
    "breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his\n",

    "hoped Sam hadn’t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it\n",
    "would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. “I\n",
    "warned him,” Jon said aloud. “It was nothing to do with him, anyway.” He flexed his\n",
    "burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him,\n",
    "but it felt good to have the wrappings off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He\n",
    "\f",
    "needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the\n",
    "morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and\n",
    "stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than\n",
    "deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many\n",
    "leagues as he could between him and the Wall . . . if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The\n",
    "fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned,\n",
    "Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the\n",
    "guards in front of the King’s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear’s breakfast from the kitchen, they’d look\n",
    "in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not\n",
    "so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he\n",
    "fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the\n",
    "blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt\n",
    "in the still-raw wound of his son’s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his\n",
    "trust, but it couldn’t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were\n",
    "betraying someone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it\n",
    "easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods’ will and help\n",
    "sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods,\n",
    "and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk.\n",
    "He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were\n",
    "holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the\n",
    "mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.\n",
    "\n",
    "He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he’d need to steal them. He was clad\n",
    "in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic,\n",
    "sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed\n",
    "in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any\n",
    "bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with\n",
    "cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be\n",
    "watching for him. Once Maester Aemon’s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no\n",
    "safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin\n",
    "had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to\n",
    "call there at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind’s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the\n",
    "\f",
    "towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting\n",
    "meat, his father’s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing\n",
    "so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage’s beef-and-bacon pies, to\n",
    "listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.\n",
    "\n",
    "But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father’s son,\n",
    "and Robb’s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make\n",
    "him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen,\n",
    "and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide\n",
    "whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was\n",
    "strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of\n",
    "choosing; he understood that all too well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it,\n",
    "but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker,\n",
    "motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life—however long that might be\n",
    "—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who\n",
    "dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms,\n",
    "he would need to live a lie, lest every man’s hand be raised against him. But it made no\n",
    "matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother’s side and help\n",
    "avenge his father.\n",
    "\n",
    "He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in\n",
    "his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine\n",
    "the look on Robb’s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head and\n",
    "smile, and he’d say . . . he’d say . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself\n",
    "thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they’d found the direwolves.\n",
    "“You said the words,” Lord Eddard had told him. “You took a vow, before your brothers,\n",
    "before the old gods and the new.” Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the\n",
    "stump. Bran’s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his\n",
    "pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father’s face when Theon Greyjoy brought\n",
    "forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it\n",
    "came rolling at his feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother\n",
    "Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must,\n",
    "surely, surely . . . and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the\n",
    "reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the\n",
    "\f",
    "kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to\n",
    "die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish,\n",
    "let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father’s killers. He was no true Stark, had\n",
    "never been one . . . but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had\n",
    "fathered four sons, not three.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth.\n",
    "Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf\n",
    "slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind,\n",
    "but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road:\n",
    "Mole’s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule’s raucous haw from\n",
    "the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires\n",
    "shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mole’s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in\n",
    "deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down\n",
    "there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red\n",
    "lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he’d heard men call the whores “buried\n",
    "treasures.” He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight,\n",
    "mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the\n",
    "mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank\n",
    "of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form\n",
    "small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff\n",
    "between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his\n",
    "face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days,\n",
    "and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I\n",
    "feel so bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road\n",
    "was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams\n",
    "and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck.\n",
    "Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die?\n",
    "\n",
    "Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His\n",
    "mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around\n",
    "his mouth. “Ghost!” he shouted. “Ghost, to me.” The only answer was a rush of wings\n",
    "behind him as an owl took flight.\n",
    "\f",
    "Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry.\n",
    "Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned\n",
    "about his missing wolf. “Ghost,” he called again. “Where are you? To me! Ghost!”\n",
    "Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf,\n",
    "unless . . . no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack\n",
    "anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.\n",
    "\n",
    "He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to\n",
    "catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a\n",
    "biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He’d brought salt beef as\n",
    "well, and a rasher of bacon he’d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat\n",
    "for the morrow. After it was gone he’d need to hunt, and that would slow him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the\n",
    "kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart\n",
    "and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the\n",
    "north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun them? No, they\n",
    "were too close, they’d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. “Ouiet now,”\n",
    "he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were\n",
    "kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole’s Town,\n",
    "farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of\n",
    "the night . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down\n",
    "the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices\n",
    "drifted through the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "“ . . . certain he came this way?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We can’t be certain.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods.\n",
    "That’s what I’d do.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“In the dark? Stupid. If you didn’t fall off your horse and break your neck, you’d get lost\n",
    "and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I would not.” Grenn sounded peeved. “I’d just ride south, you can tell south by the\n",
    "stars.”\n",
    "\f",
    "“What if the sky was cloudy?” Pyp asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Then I wouldn’t go.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Another voice broke in. “You know where I’d be if it was me? I’d be in Mole’s Town,\n",
    "digging for buried treasure.” Toad’s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon’s mare\n",
    "snorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Keep quiet, all of you,” Haider said. “I thought I heard something.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Where? I didn’t hear anything.” The horses stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You can’t hear yourself fart.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I can too,” Grenn insisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Quiet!”\n",
    "\n",
    "They all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He\n",
    "hadn’t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn’t gone to bed either, he’d woken the other boys.\n",
    "Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they’d be named deserters\n",
    "too. What did they think they were doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see\n",
    "the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. “What did you hear?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know,” Haider admitted. “A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There’s nothing here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves\n",
    "rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon’s mare\n",
    "started and gave a whinny. “There!” Halder shouted.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I heard it too!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Traitor,” Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare’s\n",
    "head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Jon!” Pyp shouted after him.\n",
    "\f",
    "“Pull up,” Grenn said. “You can’t outrun us all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. “Get back. I don’t wish to hurt you,\n",
    "but I will if I have to.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“One against seven?” Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do you want with me?” Jon demanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We want to take you back where you belong,” Pyp said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I belong with my brother.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’re your brothers now,” Grenn said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They’ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,” Toad put in with a nervous laugh.\n",
    "“This is so stupid, it’s like something the Aurochs would do.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I would not,” Grenn said. “I’m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“So did I,” Jon told them. “Don’t you understand? They murdered my father. It’s war,\n",
    "my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We know,” said Pyp solemnly. “Sam told us everything.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“We’re sorry about your father,” Grenn said, “but it doesn’t matter. Once you say the\n",
    "words, you can’t leave, no matter what.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have to,” Jon said fervently.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You said the words,” Pyp reminded him. “Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall\n",
    "not end until my death.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I shall live and die at my post,” Grenn added, nodding.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You don’t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.” He was angry now.\n",
    "Why couldn’t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am the sword in the darkness,” Halder intoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The watcher on the walls,” piped Toad.\n",
    "\f",
    "Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer,\n",
    "reciting, “I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the\n",
    "horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Stay back,” Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. “I mean it, Pyp.” They weren’t even\n",
    "wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. “I pledge my life and honor to\n",
    "the Night’s Watch.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing\n",
    "from every side.\n",
    "\n",
    "“For this night . . . ” Halder trotted in from the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "“ . . . and all the nights to come,” finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon’s reins. “So here\n",
    "are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon lifted his sword . . . and lowered it, helpless. “Damn you,” he said. “Damn you all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you’ll ride back peaceful?”\n",
    "asked Halder.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I won’t run, if that’s what you mean.” Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon\n",
    "glared at him. “Small help you were,” he said. The deep red eyes looked at him\n",
    "knowingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We had best hurry,” Pyp said. “If we’re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have\n",
    "all our heads.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south,\n",
    "perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting,\n",
    "and then breaking into another gallop. Mole’s Town came and went, the red lantern over\n",
    "the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still an hour off when\n",
    "Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity\n",
    "of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war\n",
    "would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day\n",
    "and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain\n",
    "here . . . and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would\n",
    "\f",
    "avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a\n",
    "longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the\n",
    "high passes. That was the wildling’s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid\n",
    "follow him. He wouldn’t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of\n",
    "hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. “I . . . I’m glad they found\n",
    "you, Jon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’m not,” Jon said, dismounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. “Give us a hand\n",
    "bedding down the horses, Sam,” the small boy said. “We have a long day before us, and\n",
    "no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb\n",
    "said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear’s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs\n",
    "boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried\n",
    "the food back to the King’s Tower. He found Mormont at the window seat, writing. His\n",
    "raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, “Corn, corn, corn.”\n",
    "The bird shrieked when Jon entered. “Put the food on the table,” the Old Bear said,\n",
    "glancing up. “I’ll have some beer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a\n",
    "horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist.\n",
    "The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and\n",
    "claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doubtless you loved your father,” Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. “The\n",
    "things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I remember,” Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father’s death, not even to\n",
    "Mormont.\n",
    "\n",
    "“See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my\n",
    "plate. Is it ham again? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon’s throat was dry. “You know?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Know,” the raven echoed from Mormont’s shoulder. “Know.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Old Bear snorted. “Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night’s\n",
    "\f",
    "Watch because I’m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you’d go. I told him you’d\n",
    "be back. I know my men . . . and my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad . . . and\n",
    "honor brought you back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My friends brought me back,” Jon said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Did I say it was your honor?” Mormont inspected his plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.” Mormont tried a plum, spit out\n",
    "the pit. “I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had\n",
    "not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends.\n",
    "Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No.” Jon felt like a fool.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Pity, we could use a horse like that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the\n",
    "least. “I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I’m not afraid to die.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Die!” the raven cried.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nor live, I hope,” Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the\n",
    "bird. “You have not deserted—yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to\n",
    "Mole’s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee\n",
    "again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon kept silent.\n",

    "\n",
    "“No,” he answered, sullen.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good,” Mormont said. “We’ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it’s not\n",
    "something I care to see again.” He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out\n",
    "from between his teeth. “Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north\n",
    "behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you’ll find in\n",
    "all the Night’s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a\n",

    "mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing\n",
    "his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.\n",

    "The Old Bear sighed. “You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my\n",
    "sister is marching in your brother’s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in\n",
    "men’s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be\n",
    "told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my\n",
    "love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.” Frowning, Mormont\n",
    "took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. “Or perhaps it does.\n",
    "Be that as it may, I’d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don’t see me running off. I said\n",
    "the words, just as you did. My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I’m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother,\n",
    "and now not even a father. The words would not come. “I don’t know.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I do,” said Lord Commander Mormont. “The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the\n",
    "Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and\n",
    "east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge,\n",
    "misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow\n",
    "Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires\n",
    "in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a\n",
    "captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all\n",

    "“Ben Jen. Ben Jen.”\n",

    "“No,” Jon said. There had been others. Too many.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Do you think your brother’s war is more important than ours?” the old man barked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. “War, war, war, war,” it sang.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s not,” Mormont told him. “Gods save us, boy, you’re not blind and you’re not stupid.\n",
    "When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron\n",
    "Throne?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No.” Jon had not thought of it that way.\n",

    "“Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why? Why? Why?” the raven called.\n",

    "It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of\n",
    "Riverrun, crossing the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to\n",
    "Winterfell. And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy\n",
    "wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the\n",
    "rowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would\n",
    "come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the\n",
    "strong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower. The splash and rumble of the\n",
    "great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to\n",
    "Catelyn’s face. From the sandstone walls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted\n",
    "down her name, and Robb’s, and “Winterfell!” From every rampart waved the banner of\n",
    "House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field. It was a\n",
    "stirring sight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever\n",
    "lift again. Oh, Ned . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the Wheel Tower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water.\n",
    "The men put their backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she\n",
    "heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose\n",
    "slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust.\n",
    "The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed\n",
    "spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how\n",
    "deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it\n",
    "ought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and\n",
    "back into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron\n",
    "rings set in the stone. Her father’s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser\n",
    "Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery\n",
    "beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his blue-and-red cloak\n",
    "stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood, a hard pike of a\n",
    "man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His bright yellow\n",
    "armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from\n",
    "\f",
    "raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that\n",
    "plucked her brother from the Lannister camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Bring them in,” Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-\n",
    "deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded\n",
    "out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and sitting down\n",
    "abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on his face.\n",
    "Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting\n",
    "her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edmure came down the steps to embrace her. “Sweet sister,” he murmured hoarsely. He\n",
    "had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked\n",
    "worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain. His neck was bandaged\n",
    "where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your grief is mine, Cat,” he said when they broke apart. “When we heard about Lord\n",
    "Eddard . . . the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Will that bring Ned back to me?” she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for\n",
    "softer words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not. It would not do. She\n",
    "had to be strong. “All that will keep. I must see Father.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He awaits you in his solar,” Edmure said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,” her father’s steward explained. When had that\n",
    "good man grown so old and grey? “He instructed me to bring you to him at once.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ll take her.” Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where\n",
    "Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The massive\n",
    "sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed through a door between\n",
    "two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, “How bad is he?” dreading the answer\n",
    "even as she said the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edmure’s look was somber. “He will not be with us long, the maesters say. The pain\n",
    "is . . . constant, and grievous.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa,\n",
    "at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who\n",
    "would take them both away from her. “You should have told me,” she said. “You should\n",
    "have sent word as soon as you knew.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm\n",
    "\f",
    "so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“ . . . they might attack?” Catelyn finished, hard. It was your doing, yours, a voice\n",
    "whispered inside her. If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "They climbed the spiral stair in silence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster’s solar was triangular as\n",
    "well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great\n",
    "sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and\n",
    "battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her father’s bed out\n",
    "onto the balcony. “He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,” Edmure explained.\n",
    "“Father, see who I’ve brought. Cat has come to see you . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew\n",
    "older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his\n",
    "face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown,\n",
    "well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow.\n",
    "\n",
    "His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure’s voice. “Little cat,” he murmured in a voice\n",
    "thin and wispy and wracked by pain. “My little cat.” A tremulous smile touched his face\n",
    "as his hand groped for hers. “I watched for you . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I shall leave you to talk,” her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow\n",
    "before he withdrew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand in hers. It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the\n",
    "bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. “You should have told\n",
    "me,” she said. “A rider, a raven . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Riders are taken, questioned,” he answered. “Ravens are brought down . . . ” A spasm of\n",
    "pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. “The crabs are in my\n",
    "belly . . . pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, the crabs.\n",
    "Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy . . . I sleep a lot . . . but I\n",
    "wanted to be awake to see you, when you came. I was afraid . . . when the Lannisters\n",
    "took your brother, the camps all around us . . . was afraid I would go, before I could see\n",
    "you again . . . I was afraid . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’m here, Father,” she said. “With Robb, my son. He’ll want to see you too.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your boy,” he whispered. “He had my eyes, I remember . . . ”\n",
    "\f",
    "“He did, and does. And we’ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons. Riverrun is free\n",
    "again, Father.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord Hoster smiled. “I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them . . . had to see. They\n",
    "carried me to the gatehouse . . . watched from the battlements. Ah, that was\n",
    "beautiful . . . the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the\n",
    "river . . . sweet cries . . . when that siege tower went up, gods . . . would have died then,\n",
    "and glad, if only I could have seen you children first. Was it your boy who did it? Was it\n",
    "your Robb?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes,” Catelyn said, fiercely proud. “It was Robb . . . and Brynden. Your brother is here\n",
    "as well, my lord.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Him.” Her father’s voice was a faint whisper. “The Blackfish . . . came back? From the\n",
    "Vale?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And Lysa?” A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. “Gods be good, your\n",
    "sister . . . did she come as well?”\n",
    "\n",
    "He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. “No. I’m\n",
    "sorry . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh.” His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. “I’d hoped I would have liked to\n",
    "see her, before . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“She’s with her son, in the Eyrie.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lord Hoster gave a weary nod. “Lord Robert now, poor Arryn’s gone . . . I\n",
    "remember . . . why did she not come with you?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“She is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.” She kissed his wrinkled brow.\n",
    "“Robb will be waiting. Will you see him? And Brynden?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your son,” he whispered. “Yes. Cat’s child . . . he had my eyes, I remember. When he\n",
    "was born. Bring him . . . yes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“And your brother?”\n",
    "\n",

    "\f",
    "some . . . girl to wife?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Even on his deathbed, Catelyn thought sadly. “He has not wed. You know that, Father.\n",

    "\n",
    "“I told him . . . commanded him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to make his\n",

    "“Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,” Catelyn reminded him. “She has three\n",
    "children by him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Even so,” Lord Hoster muttered. “Even so. Spit on the girl. The Redwynes. Spit on me.\n",
    "His lord, his brother . . . that Blackfish. I had other offers. Lord Bracken’s girl. Walder\n",
    "Frey . . . any of three, he said . . . Has he wed? Anyone? Anyone?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No one,” Catelyn said, “yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back\n",
    "to Riverrun. I would not be here now, if Ser Brynden had not helped us.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He was ever a warrior,” her father husked. “That he could do. Knight of the Gate, yes.”\n",
    "He leaned back and closed his eyes, inutterably weary. “Send him. Later. I’ll sleep now.\n",
    "Too sick to fight. Send him up later, the Blackfish . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "Catelyn kissed him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep,\n",
    "with his rivers flowing beneath. He was asleep before she left the solar.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she returned to the lower bailey, Ser Brynden Tully stood on the water stairs with\n",
    "wet boots, talking with the captain of Riverrun’s guards. He came to her at once. “Is he—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dying,” she said. “As we feared.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Her uncle’s craggy face showed his pain plain. He ran his fingers through his thick grey\n",
    "hair. “Will he see me?”\n",
    "\n",
    "She nodded. “He says he is too sick to fight.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Brynden Blackfish chuckled. “I am too old a soldier to believe that. Hoster will be\n",

    "Catelyn smiled, knowing it was true. “I do not see Robb.”\n",
    "\f",
    "“He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun’s Great Hall, enjoying a horn of ale\n",
    "and regaling her father’s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering\n",
    "Wood. “Some tried to flee, but we’d pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode\n",
    "out of the darkness with sword and lance. The Lannisters must have thought the Others\n",
    "themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb’s got in among them. I saw him tear\n",
    "one man’s arm from his shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him. I\n",
    "couldn’t tell you how many men were thrown—”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Theon,” she interrupted, “where might I find my son?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lord Robb went to visit the godswood, my lady.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It was what Ned would have done. He is his father’s son as much as mine, I must\n",
    "remember. Oh, gods, Ned . . .\n",
    "\n",
    "She found Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and\n",
    "great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad\n",
    "than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in the earth, his gloved\n",
    "hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others knelt: Greatjon Umber, Rickard\n",
    "Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. Even Tytos Blackwood was\n",
    "among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind him. These are the ones who keep\n",
    "the old gods, she realized. She asked herself what gods she kept these days, and could\n",
    "not find an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their due . . . even\n",
    "cruel gods who would take Ned from her, and her lord father as well. So Catelyn waited.\n",
    "The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to\n",
    "her right, ivy crawling up its side. As she stood there, all the memories came flooding\n",
    "back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees, and that was the elm\n",
    "that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm, and over there, beneath that\n",
    "bower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr.\n",
    "\n",
    "She had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been—she no older than\n",
    "Sansa, Lysa younger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The girls had traded\n",
    "him between them, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly she\n",
    "could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath.\n",
    "There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr had liked to chew it. He had\n",
    "been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. “He tried to put his tongue in my mouth,”\n",
    "Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when they were alone. “He did with me\n",
    "too,” Lysa had whispered, shy and breathless. “I liked it.”\n",
    "\f",
    "Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering\n",
    "whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must have. She had\n",
    "seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones\n",
    "as old as eighteen . . . he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely he had\n",
    "been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away angrily.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mother,” Robb said when he saw her standing there. “We must call a council. There are\n",
    "things to be decided.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your grandfather would like to see you,” she said. “Robb, he’s very sick.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother . . . for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet first we\n",
    "must meet. We’ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother’s\n",
    "crown.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Renly?” she said, shocked. “I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "“So did we all, my lady,” Galbart Glover said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables arranged in a\n",
    "broken square. Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his balcony, dreaming of\n",
    "the sun on the rivers of his youth. Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with\n",
    "Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father’s bannermen arrayed to right and left and\n",
    "along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of\n",

    "the tables would permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the\n",
    "tables. They were fewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb’s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy;\n",
    "Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn. Lord Rickard Karstark,\n",
    "gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man in a nightmare, his long\n",

    "and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against\n",

    "\n",

    "did . . . and shout, and curse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and bargain, and slam\n",
    "tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn\n",

    "sat and listened to it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of\n",
    "the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin’s\n",
    "army had crossed the Trident, and was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings\n",
    "in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord\n",
    "Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a\n",
    "strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat\n",
    "athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time,\n",
    "denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses\n",
    "and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish\n",
    "the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose\n",
    "Bolton’s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord\n",
    "Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move\n",
    "south to join their might to his.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Renly is not the king,” Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his\n",
    "father, he knew how to listen.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,” Galbart Glover said. “He put your father\n",
    "to death.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That makes him evil,” Robb replied. “I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is\n",
    "still Robert’s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the\n",
    "realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother.\n",
    "Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Tommen is no less a Lannister,” Ser Marq Piper snapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "“As you say,” said Robb, troubled. “Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord\n",
    "Renly? He’s Robert’s younger brother. Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and\n",
    "Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Lady Mormont agreed. “Lord Stannis has the better claim.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Renly is crowned,” said Marq Piper. “Highgarden and Storm’s End support his claim,\n",
    "and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength\n",
    "to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir\n",
    "themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads\n",
    "on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan,\n",
    "\f",
    "all of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord\n",
    "Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The right,” said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as\n",
    "he said it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“So you mean us to declare for Stannis?” asked Edmure.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know,” said Robb. “I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer.\n",
    "The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is\n",
    "the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“My lord father would urge caution,” aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile of a\n",
    "Frey. “Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting,\n",
    "we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we choose. With Renly arming,\n",
    "likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce . . . and the safe return of his son. Noble lords,\n",
    "allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms . . . ”\n",
    "\n",
    "A roar of outrage drowned out his voice. “Craven!” the Greatjon thundered. “Begging for\n",
    "a truce will make us seem weak,” declared Lady Mormont. “Ransoms be damned, we\n",
    "must not give up the Kingslayer,” shouted Rickard Karstark.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why not a peace?” Catelyn asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lords looked at her, but it was Robb’s eyes she felt, his and his alone. “My lady, they\n",
    "murdered my lord father, your husband,” he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword\n",
    "and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the rough wood. “This is the only\n",
    "peace I have for Lannisters.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greatjon bellowed his approval, and other men added their voices, shouting and\n",
    "drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had\n",
    "quieted. “My lords,” she said then, “Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and\n",
    "bore his children. Do you think I love him any less than you?” Her voice almost broke\n",
    "with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. “Robb, if that sword\n",
    "could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once\n",
    "more . . . but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is\n",
    "gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark’s valiant sons, and many other good\n",
    "men besides, and none of them will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?”\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a woman, my lady, the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice.Women do not\n",
    "understand these things.\n",
    "You are the gentle sex, said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. “A\n",
    "man has a need for vengeance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can\n",
    "be,” Catelyn replied. “Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy but I\n",
    "understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands,\n",
    "and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We fought to defend ourselves, and\n",
