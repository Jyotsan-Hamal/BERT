# BERT Transformer Learning Journey

![BERT Transformer](images/bert_transformer.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to my BERT Transformer Learning Journey! In this repository, I am documenting my process of learning about the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and its application in natural language processing tasks. My ultimate goal is to build a Language Model using the PyTorch framework, starting from scratch. I am also delving into intuitive mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.

## Current Progress

As of today, I have embarked on this exciting learning journey. I have set up the repository, gathered relevant resources, and familiarized myself with the basic concepts of transformers and BERT architecture. I am progressing through the implementation of the BERT model using PyTorch, step by step.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: This directory contains the Python code for implementing BERT using PyTorch. I am breaking down the implementation into manageable modules to better understand each component.

- `notebooks/`: Here, I am documenting my progress through Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook covers a specific aspect of the learning process and includes both code and explanations.

- `resources/`: I am collecting relevant research papers, blog posts, tutorials, and other useful materials in this directory. This will help me deepen my understanding and keep track of the resources I've found valuable.

- `images/`: I've gathered visual aids and diagrams related to the BERT model and its components. These visuals aid in comprehending complex concepts.

## Learning Approach

I am taking a comprehensive approach to learning, which includes:

1. **Understanding Transformer Architecture**: Before diving into BERT, I am ensuring a solid grasp of the core transformer architecture, which forms the basis for BERT.

2. **Learning BERT Intuitively**: I believe that a deeper understanding of the mathematics behind BERT is essential. I am dedicating time to study intuitive math concepts related to linear algebra and attention mechanisms.

3. **Hands-on Implementation**: Alongside theory, I am actively implementing BERT using PyTorch. This hands-on approach helps me solidify my understanding and overcome implementation challenges.

4. **Building a Language Model**: Once I'm confident with BERT, I will extend my knowledge to construct a Language Model using the principles I've learned.

## Future Steps

- Complete the implementation of BERT using PyTorch.
- Deepen my understanding of intuitive mathematics related to transformers.
- Begin working on the Language Model using the knowledge gained from BERT.

**Interest in Research Paper**: As my understanding deepens, I am considering the possibility of writing a research paper in the future, focusing on a specific aspect of BERT or its application. This would be a culmination of my learning journey and a contribution to the NLP research community.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey of learning, implementation, and exploration!
